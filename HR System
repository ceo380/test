# HR System — Step 1: MVP Definition

This document defines the **first releasable version (MVP)** of the HR system.

## 1) MVP Goal

Deliver a secure web application that lets an organization:
- maintain core employee records,
- process leave requests end-to-end,
- capture attendance,
- store essential HR documents,
- and enforce role-based access.

## 2) Roles in MVP

- **Admin**: platform-level controls, user/role setup.
- **HR**: full employee and leave management.
- **Manager**: approve/reject leave for direct reports; view team data.
- **Employee**: view/update own profile fields, request leave, view attendance and documents.

## 3) In-Scope Modules (MVP)

### 3.1 Employee Records

#### Core data fields
- Employee ID (unique)
- Full name
- Work email / phone
- Department
- Job title
- Manager
- Employment type (full-time/contract/intern)
- Join date
- Employment status (active/inactive)

#### MVP actions
- Create employee profile (HR/Admin)
- Edit employee profile (HR/Admin; limited self-edit for Employee)
- View employee list and profile details
- Search/filter by department, status, manager

### 3.2 Leave Management

#### Leave types
- Annual leave
- Sick leave
- Unpaid leave

#### MVP actions
- Employee submits leave request (dates, type, reason)
- Manager approves/rejects
- HR override capability
- Leave balance tracking
- Leave calendar view (team-level)

### 3.3 Attendance Tracking

#### MVP actions
- Daily check-in/check-out (manual)
- Attendance status (present/absent/on leave)
- Monthly attendance summary per employee
- Basic manager/team attendance view

### 3.4 Document Management

#### MVP actions
- Upload key employee documents (contract, ID, certifications)
- Restrict access by role
- Version history metadata (uploaded by/date)
- Download/view files

### 3.5 Access Control & Security

#### MVP actions
- Role-based access control (Admin/HR/Manager/Employee)
- Secure login
- Password reset flow
- Audit log for critical events:
  - employee profile changes,
  - leave approvals/rejections,
  - document upload/delete.

## 4) Out of Scope (Post-MVP)

- Full payroll calculation engine
- Multi-country compliance packs
- Performance reviews/OKRs
- Recruitment/ATS workflow
- Advanced analytics and BI dashboards
- Mobile native app

## 5) MVP Success Criteria

The MVP is successful when:
- HR can onboard and manage all employees digitally.
- Employees can submit leave requests and receive decisions through the system.
- Managers can process team leave and view attendance.
- Sensitive files are stored with role-restricted access.
- The system logs critical actions for accountability.

## 6) Suggested Timeline (High-level)

- **Week 1–2:** Authentication + RBAC + employee records base
- **Week 3–4:** Leave management workflow + balances
- **Week 5:** Attendance module (manual check-in/out + summaries)
- **Week 6:** Documents + audit logs + hardening + UAT

## 7) What to Do With This Document (Action Plan)

Use this MVP definition as a **decision baseline** and execute these tasks in order.

### 7.1 Align stakeholders (Day 1)
- Share this document with one HR lead, one manager, and one technical owner.
- Collect decisions only on:
  - leave types,
  - mandatory employee fields,
  - approval hierarchy,
  - compliance constraints.
- Timebox to a single 60-minute review; avoid adding new features.

### 7.2 Freeze scope (Day 1)
- Move every non-MVP request to a `Post-MVP backlog` list.
- Mark this document version as `v1.0 (scope-frozen)`.
- Require explicit approval before changing Section 3.

### 7.3 Convert to build tickets (Day 2)
Create implementation tickets grouped by module:
- Auth + RBAC
- Employee records
- Leave workflow
- Attendance
- Documents
- Audit logging

Each ticket should include:
- user story,
- acceptance criteria,
- API/data impact,
- and test cases.

### 7.4 Define Step 2 outputs (Day 2–3)
Produce three concrete artifacts:
1. Data model (ERD + table schema draft)
2. API contract (REST endpoints for each module)
3. System architecture diagram (frontend/backend/db/storage/auth)

### 7.5 Start implementation only after sign-off (Day 3)
The team can start coding when:
- scope is frozen,
- Step 2 artifacts are reviewed,
- and the first sprint backlog is approved.

## 8) Step 2 Kickoff Checklist

Use this checklist immediately:
- [ ] Confirm target company size and region(s)
- [ ] Select tech stack (frontend, backend, database)
- [ ] Draft ERD for employee/leave/attendance/documents
- [ ] Define role-permission matrix
- [ ] Write endpoint list and request/response shapes
- [ ] Define audit log event schema
- [ ] Break work into Sprint 1 tickets

## 9) Immediate Next Step (Step 2 Input)

Proceed to **system design and data model**:
- define entities and relationships,
- draft API endpoints,
- choose implementation stack,
- and create a role-permission matrix.
